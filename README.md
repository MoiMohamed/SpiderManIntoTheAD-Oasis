# Objective
The goal of the game is to outrun the monster for as long as possible while dodging deadly spikes and obstacles.
Collect points by catching criminals on platforms and surviving longer.

### Gameplay Mechanics
##### Mouse Interactions
1. Swinging on Hooks:
• Press and hold the left mouse button near a hook to attach your character to it and start swinging.
• Release the mouse button to detach from the hook and launch yourself in the desired direction.
• No keyboard interactions are required for gameplay. The game is controlled entirely using the mouse.
##### Gameplay Tips
1. Use hooks strategically to swing over obstacles and avoid falling off the screen.
2. Avoid deadly spikes, which will end your game instantly.
3. Non-deadly obstacles will slow you down but won’t kill you. Nonetheless, if you fall onto an obstacle from
above, it will be challenging to return swinging.
4. Catch criminals on platforms for bonus points:
• Regular criminals: +50 points
• Boss criminals: +250 points
5. The monster speeds up over time, so stay ahead by swinging efficiently.
##### Scoring System
• Survive longer to earn more points.
• Bonus points are awarded for passing through criminals on platforms.
• Swiping below the boundaries will stop the score increase.

##### End Conditions
The game ends if:
1. The monster catches you.
2. You hit a deadly spike.
3. You fall below the map boundaries.
